#   TrackEEEr Server
#       Notes:
#        a. To make sqlite3 database, install via "sudo apt-get install sqlite"
#        b. Make database by "sqlite3 trackeeer"
#        c. Create table by "sqlite> CREATE TABLE trackeeed (tracked_user text, desc text, gen_location text, last_update text);"
#        d. Don't forget to exit by inputting "sqlite> .quit"
#
#       Update (May 05 2017) - Tested with sampleclient.py and dummy data. Works.

#   May 02 2017 - Added socket communication functionality
#   May 05 2017 - Added filtering of data received and max RSSI detection
#   May 06 2017 - Added parsing of json object and database update
